## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vatrivedi/SolvedPuzzlesCSharp/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Array & Strings
## 1.1 Is Unique Stiring (UniqueString.cs) 
### Implement an algo to determine if a string has all unique characters.

## 1.2 Check Permutation (IsStringPermutation.cs)
### Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of other. A Permutation of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are Permutation of each other. 

## 1.3 URLify (URLify.cs)
### Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20"

## 1.4 Palindrome Permutation (PalindronePermutation.cs)
### Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is same forwards and backwards.

## 1.5 One Away (OneAway.cs)
### There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings. Insert a character, remove a character or replace a character. Given 2 strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away
 
## 1.6 String Compression (StringCompression.cs)
### Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For e.g. - the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the compressed stirng would not become small than the original string, your method should return the original string.

## 1.7 Rotate Matrix (RotateMatrix.cs)
### Given a N*N matrix , write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees

## 1.8 Zero Matrix (ZeroMatrix.cs)
### Write an algo such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0

## 1.9 String Rotation (StringRotation.cs)
### Assume you have a method iSubstring which checks if one word is substring of another. Given 2 strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g. waterbottle is a rotation of  erbottlewat)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vatrivedi/SolvedPuzzlesCSharp/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
